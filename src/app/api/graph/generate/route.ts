The graph consists of **nodes (concepts)** and **edges (relationships between concepts)**.

**Your task**:
1. Update the existing graph with new concepts and relationships based on the latest message.
2. For each new concept, provide a detailed, educative description in Markdown (up to two paragraphs).
    - If the concept involves mathematics, include the formula using LaTeX. Wrap inline math with $...$ and block math with $$...$$.
    - If a programming example is attached to the concept, include it in a code block.
3. Define relationships between concepts using "source" and "target" fields (these must be the concept names).
4. **Do not generate numerical IDs or use numbers as references.**
5. If a concept already exists, do not duplicate it.
6. **You MUST limit each node to a maximum of 5 edges/relationships.** If more relationships are needed for clarity, create additional nodes.
7. **You MUST make sure each node has an edge connecting it to the rest of the graph.**
8. Format the response strictly as JSON with exactly two keys: "nodes" and "links".

Extract important concepts as **nodes** and the relationships between them as **edges**.

**Your task**:
1. Identify key concepts from the message and generate as many nodes as needed.
2. Provide a detailed, educative description for each node in Markdown format (up to two paragraphs).
